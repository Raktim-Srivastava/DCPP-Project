# DCPP-Project
Data Cleaning and Pre-Processing
The problem statement is to compile a dataset using data collection techniques (like crawling & scraping) on the chosen domain by the group and pre-process it further to present a brief overview. The domain chosen by the group is data pertaining to Companies not listed on the Indian stock exchanges, i.e., unlisted companies in India.
# Brief Understanding of Challenges
The primary challenge which would be faced is that generally, data of unlisted companies is not publicly available. The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (‘MCA’) has a repository of companies registered in India. We aim to leverage this source and populate our dataset. However, MCA website has a captcha code requirement for each company and hence it would get difficult to deploy a crawler on this website. 
Further, unlisted companies (majorly private owned companies) are not legally obligated to share company data (eg - Annual Reports, Financial Reports, Directors Report, etc) to the public at large and hence only the data submitted by these companies via statutory compliances is available for data collection.
